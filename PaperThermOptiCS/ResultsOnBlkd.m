% This code gets the results on list of stochiometrically blocked and thermodynamically blocked
% reactions in bigg database. Also it gets the list of TICs and the respective direactions
% Results of 99 models are given in the folder 'BiggBlkdResults'. For
% remaining models that ran for more than 24 hrs only partially identifed
% TICs are provided (These models have the name prefix 'Incom')
